# display_greeting

This app creates a window with a label and an entry field for the user to input their name, a button to submit the input, and a label to display the greeting message. When the user clicks the "Submit" button, the display_greeting() function is called, which retrieves the user's name from the entry field and sets the text of the greeting label to the appropriate message.
